We can treat the currencies $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ as vertices and the exchange rates $r_{i, j}$ as directed edges $(c_i, c_j)$ with weight $r_{i, j}$. $G = (V, E), V = c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n, E = \{r_{i, j}\ |\ i, j \in \mathbb{N^+}, i \leq n, j \leq n\}$

We want to find the optimal path from $s \in V$ to $t \in V$. The optimal path is defined as the path that maximises the output of $t$. This is the path with the highest accumulative exchange rate. There may not exists an optimal path if $G$ contains circles with an accumulative exchange rate greater than $1$.

Exchange rates are accumulated by multiplication.
